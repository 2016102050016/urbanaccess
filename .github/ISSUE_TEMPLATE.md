Please note that while GTFS feeds are a standardized format, not all transit services follow the same data standards or supply all of the necessary information in their GTFS feed that are required for UrbanAccess to compute a travel time weighted graph.  UrbanAccess attempts to deal with the most common GTFS feed data schema issues however it is expected some GTFS feeds may raise errors or may not fit the expected data schema. If you encounter a bug in UrbanAccess please: 1) first search the previously opened issues to see if the problem has already been reported; 2) If not, fill in the template below and tag with the appropriate `Type` label and `Data` label is applicable. You can delete any sections that do not apply.
